//   1. Listen on TCP 127.0.0.1:5288 (+ NSD _aawireless._tcp).
//   2. Launch Google Android Auto's WirelessStartupActivity pointed at 127.0.0.1:5288 (no VPN).
//   3. Accept the inbound socket, run the AAP version+SSL handshake, point the H.264 decoder at
//      the supplied encoder Surface, and start the message loop → AA video flows into the encoder.
