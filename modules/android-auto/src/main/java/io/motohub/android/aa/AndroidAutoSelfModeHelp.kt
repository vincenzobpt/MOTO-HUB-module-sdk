/**
 * The one prerequisite MOTO-HUB cannot check or set for the rider.
 *
 * Lives in src/main, not src/core, because the ADVANCED home screen reads [RiderStep] to draw the
 * step the rider has to carry out - and src/pro cannot see src/core. Everything it touches is
 * framework, so both flavours can carry it; core-publish keeps it in src/main for the same reason.
 *
 * Google Android Auto only projects to a head unit it is willing to accept, and a sideloaded one
 * counts as an unknown car: until "Add new cars to Android Auto" (older wording: "Unknown
 * sources") is enabled inside Android Auto's own developer settings, the projection request is
 * simply ignored — the app is asked to start and silently does nothing, which is exactly what a
 * refusal looks like from here. There is no public API to read or toggle it, so all that can be
 * done is name the step and deep-link to the screen.

     * The boundary is a warning, never a refusal, and this is why: a rider log of 2026-07-31
     * (OnePlus CPH2653) running that same 17.2.662634 had WirelessStartupActivity refused as not

     * rollout - and what actually separates the two failures is whether an entry point ACCEPTED
     * the intent. See [ACCEPTED_BUT_SILENT_MESSAGE]. The boundary is left where it is rather than
     * widened to 17.2: it would then fire for every rider on a release that does work for most
