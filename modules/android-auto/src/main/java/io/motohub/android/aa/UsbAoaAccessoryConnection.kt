/**
 * [AccessoryConnection] over a physical USB AOA accessory (the external head unit), instead of
 * the loopback socket [SocketAccessoryConnection] uses to talk to Google's own Android Auto app.
 * The accessory is opened by the app and lent here as two streams: the file descriptor and its
 * lifetime stay on that side.
 *
 * A dedicated thread keeps one blocking read of [BULK_READ_SIZE] bytes outstanding from the
 * moment this is built, and [recvBlocking] takes from what it has buffered. Two things about the
 * accessory device force this shape:
 *
 *  - `available()` never reports anything on it. It is an `ioctl(FIONREAD)` the accessory driver
 *    does not implement, and the gadget side only receives a bulk transfer while a read is
 *    queued, so there is never anything waiting to be counted. The earlier version polled
 *    `available()` before reading, and so never read at all: that is the "the head unit put no
 *    byte on the wire" of the 2026-09-07 probe. Some head units also give up on a phone that has
 *    not read within about a second.
 *  - One read returns one bulk transfer. Asking for six bytes of header when a whole frame has
 *    arrived risks the rest of that transfer, so reads always ask for a full buffer and frames
 *    are cut out of the bytes afterwards.
